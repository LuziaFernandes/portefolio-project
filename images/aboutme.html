    <h3>Front-end based in Porto, Portugal</h3>
    <div class="description"> Hello, I am Luzia Fernandes. I am a Portuguese girl born in Lisbon, but currently I live in Porto. Not long ago, I join GuestReady company, as a customer support specialist. I am enjoying very much, because my team is full of great people! At the same time, I am taking the SheCodes course, with Matt Delac :) I am looking to improve my coding skills and maybe assess a different career  path.     </div>

   <h3 class="text-center"> What I could bring to the table?</h3>
   <div class="description text-center"> 
    I start working at 18 years, while I was in college. I have a bachelor degree in Biology and I specialize in Molecular Biology. During the time, I waitress in restaurants and did barmaid in bars, in Bairro Alto and Cais do Sodr√©. During this time, I improved a lot of my language skills, because the customers were mainly foreigners. 



    For this reason, when I finish my course and although I met a lot of great people and love the course, I started to become more and more interested in the tourism area. For 3 years now, I work as a customer support and reservations manager in a line hotels and home rental properties companies. At the moment, is awesome but I would love to grow and build a strong career in this area, but in another department :) And maybe one day, work from myself, in my own project - that would be the DREAM! I think SheCodes course will bring me a lot of oportunities, because coding skills are highly value in the working market, nowadays!
